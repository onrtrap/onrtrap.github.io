        Hi, my name is Orion Noel Roberts, and this is a site for me to keep track of my projects. I'll update this as I complete more things, so make sure to come back from time to time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I utilize a variety of languages to complete projects. I believe that it's best to write in the language that is at the intersection of good understanding and suitability. However, I do prefer to use Java on the backend and JavaScript on the frontend personally.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a wide variety of interests in software development and computer science, such as game design, app development, etc. I also hope to progressively grow stronger in coding in a variety of languages, especially C++, Java, JavaScript, and SQL for the time being.
