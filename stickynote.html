                The Sticky Note project is a project originating in Java to create a time management 
                application.  Its goal is to apply the principles of Kanban to a time management app 
                as well as provide the functions of a standard time management app.

            <h2>
                The Kanban Time Management app starts on a screen with two options: Starting a new
                "board" or opening a saved board.  Kanban data can be saved into a json file, which can be read to recreate previous boards.  
            </h2>
            <img src= "docs/assets/images/kanbanmain.jpg" alt = "The board used in the application." class="center">
            <h2>
                The main part of the application allows you to add virtual sticky notes to a board, up to 10, and name them whatever you'd like as well as write whatever you'd like on them.
                There were plans for additional features such as a timed sticky note, but it is not working as of this moment.

            <h2>
                Sticky notes can be moved however one would like, allowing you to manipulate them in such a way to suit your needs, whether it is brainstorming, setting up tasks for the day, or anything else.
            </h2>
            <img src= "docs/assets/images/kanbancolor.jpg" alt = "Sticky notes of a different color than the default" class="center">
            <h2>
                There were also plans for placing sticky notes of different colors, possibly individually, to further increase the tools that can be utilized, but this was not achieved at the time.
