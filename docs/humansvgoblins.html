		<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
		<p>Still a work in progress, this project displays the use of multiple classes to create a 3D game engine.  An end plan for the project also involves
		the use of sprites for enemies, an inventory, etc.</p>
		<img src= "onrtrap.github.io/docs/assets/images/hvg3.jpg" alt = "Another picture of the program in action">
		<p>The player is able to navigate the map using the keyboard, as well as rotate their character's POV.  Collision also exists, so players can't walk through walls.</p>
		<img src= "onrtrap.github.io/docs/assets/images/hvg2.jpg" alt = "An image used to create the game map">
		<p>The game uses code that reads the pixels from a png file and uses their hexadecimal values to create the game map using the provided image files as textures.</p>
