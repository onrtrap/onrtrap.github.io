        <p><em>3/26/2024-</em> After a long while, I have continued work on the website, although there were changes in between.
        For example, the addition of various test projects in Javascript. The big change this time was the overhauling of the 
    admittedly amateur front page design for something more appealing.  There are some issues with the javascript that would be
    nice to fix, but it's functional for the time being.  Where possible, I'll work on updating the site, although in some places
    it may be more challenging.
    <br> <br>
    <em>6/2/2023-</em> After some issues with displaying images, the 1.0 version of the 
        website has been pushed to Github.  However, there are many things to do, such as further 
    document projects I have done since the last time I worked on the website.  I'm not yet sure 
exactly what I want to add to the website in terms of improvements, but perhaps some simple quality
of life fixes that will make things look nicer for whoever is looking at the website.  I would like to
add div tags for the css template file for the project pages, for example. A carousel-type display for images would be amazing, 
but given the trouble I had implementing it in angular, I'm not very confident it will work out the way 
I would like.  Nevertheless, I will try it out.
For right now, I need to focus on updating my progress, however.

<em>6/5/2023-</em> I have begun to add some changes to make the site look a bit nicer: changing colors,
rounding out edges, etc.  I also am trying to keep a theme to the colors, as you may have noticed. 
There's a possiblity I might change the color scheme later.
<br> <br>
<em>6/17/2023-</em> I have been busy with work, but I have created a small game.  It's name is Speed Pong. 
It's just a bit of a riff on regular Pong where the ball constantly gets faster, and I still need to iron out 
some of the bugs and make it look nicer.  Nevertheless, it is there, and the website landing is a mess, so I'll need to work on that next.
