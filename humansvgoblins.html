		<h1><strong>3d Project (2022, Paused)</strong></h1>
		<img src= "docs/assets/images/hvg1.JPG" alt = "The Humans v Goblins program" class="center">
		<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
		<p>Still a work in progress, this project displays the use of multiple classes to create a 3D game engine.  An end plan for the project also involves
		the use of sprites for enemies, an inventory, etc.</p>
		<img src= "docs/assets/images/hvg2.JPG" alt = "Another picture of the program in action" class="center">
		<p>The player is able to navigate the map using the keyboard, as well as rotate their character's POV.  Collision also exists, so players can't walk through walls.</p>
		<img src= "docs/assets/images/hvg3.JPG" alt = "An image used to create the game map" class="center">
		<p>The game uses code that reads the pixels from a png file and uses their hexadecimal values to create the game map using the provided image files as textures.</p>
		<p>It is possible that I will come back to this, but for the time being I have put it somewhat on the backburner.</p>
		<h1><strong>Current 3D Projects</strong></h1>
		<p>Our current 3D project is intended to render 3D spaces in the "2.5D" format used by games such as <em>Octopath Traveler</em> or <em>Paper Mario</em>.</p>
